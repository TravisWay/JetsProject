# Jets Project
## Second-Week Graded Project
### Travis Way, Skill Distillery student

This is my week 2 homework project.   Key Topics include:
*OOP
*Inheritance
*Polymorphism
*Refactoring



The user will be prompted by a menu screen as the program is run.  They will have the choice of seeing a list of Jets in the hangar, finding the fastest plane, finding the plane with the longest range, adding a plane to the hangar, viewing pilots in the barracks, adding pilots to the barracks or quitting the application.

The jet objects are all added to an object array and finding either the fastest or the plane with the longest range involves searching that array.  Adding a plane takes in the necessary parameters and adds it to the object array so that they may be seen and searchable as well.

The pilot objects are all added to an array as well.  The pilots are assigned to planes randomly.  Adding a pilot takes in the name adds him/her to the object array so that they are visible in the 'list pilot option.'
